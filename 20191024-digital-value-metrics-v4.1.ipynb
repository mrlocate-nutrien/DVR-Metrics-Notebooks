    "#### Engagement (Digital)\n",
    "- Engaged Customer: A business organization that does (or has done) business with Nutrien, with one or more users of the on-line portal acting on behalf of the business, and those user members of the business have __returned__ to the portal two or more times collectively, aggregated at the business organization level. \n",
    "  - Engagement is expected to __increase__ as digitally adopted customers return to use the portal\n",
    "  - For the current analyses, once a household (aka customer) is engaged it is considered engaged for the prior year and the current year of the DVR analysis. Future versions of the analysis will consider the date of first engagement (the date of adoption == logging in for the first time and linking one or more accounts) \n",
    "  - Examples:\n",
    "    - 1. An organization with a single portal user who has visited a first time to register, and then comes back to the portal two or more times, is classified as an engaged customer.\n",
    "    - 2. An organization with two portal users who have both visited a first time to register, and then one comes back to the portal two or more times, is classified as an engaged customer.\n",
    "    - 3. An organization with three portal users who have all visited the portal one time to register, and then none ever come back to the portal, is classified as a non-engaged customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retention\n",
    "- Retention: Count(Households with 2018 purchases who ALSO have 2019 purchases) / Count(Households with 2018 purchases)\n",
    "- == Count(Households with prior year purchases who ALSO have current year purchases) / Count(Households with prior year purchases)\n",
    "  - Purchases for current year are YTD based on records to-date in the data set \n",
    "  - Retention is expected to __increase__ throughout the current year as prior year accounts for a household are activated (bought against) in the current year\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Churn\n",
    "- Churn: Count(Households with prior yr purchases but no current yr purchases) / Count(Households with prior year purchases)\n",
    "  - Purchases for current year are YTD based on records to-date in the data set \n",
    "  - Churn is expected to __decrease__ over the current year as prior year accounts get activated in the current year\n",
    "  - Churn of engaged customers is expected to be __less than__ churn from non-engaged customers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Customer:\n",
    "- New Customer: (Households with 2019 account purchases but no 2018 account purchases)\n",
    "  - Purchases for current year are YTD based on records to-date in the data set \n",

    "\n",
    "- The label of engagement for an organization is attributed to all transaction records for that organization. In other words, transactions for organization are considered engaged for all-time if the organization is engaged at any time. Households engaged (having 2 return visits) since April 2018 have the same engagement attribution as households with 2 return visits as of yesterday. Future versions of the DVR analysis may take into account timing of first portal use as a feature explaining variation of transactional or in-portal behaviors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the current analysis we are just looking at Net Sales, not Gross Sales nor margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- User ID tracking in the Digital Portal was turned on in Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager August 19, 2018 and became fully functional August 20 2018. This means that usage of the portal for early users, and by association the organization they are part of, will not be tracked in GA until August 20. A partial workaround is to use the date of portal registration in Customer MDM, this gives the date of first visit.  \n",
    "\n",

    "- The current implementation includes customers that both did and did not purchase products from CXH. A future implementation is required to isolate the CXH purchaser cohort. \n",
